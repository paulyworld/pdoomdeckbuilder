I'd be happy to explain the project structure in detail:

## Project Structure Breakdown

### Root Directory
- `ai-risk-deckbuilder/` - The main project folder containing everything

### Configuration Files
- `webpack.config.js` - Configures how your JavaScript files are bundled for the browser
- `package.json` - Lists all dependencies and scripts for running/building the project

### Source Directory (`src/`)
This is where all your actual game code and assets live.

#### Assets (`src/assets/`)
This organizes all non-code resources the game needs:

- **Images (`images/`)**:
  - `cards/` - Contains all card images:
    - Card backs, card templates for each risk category (alignment, misuse, etc.)
    - Each card has its own unique visual style based on its category
  
  - `ui/` - User interface elements:
    - Background images
    - Buttons, icons, and UI frames
    - Map nodes and connections
    - Loading bar graphics
  
  - `characters/` - Character sprites:
    - Player character
    - Enemy graphics for different AI threat types

- **Audio (`audio/`)**:
  - Would contain sound effects and music (empty in prototype)
  - Card play sounds, combat effects, UI clicks, background music

#### JavaScript Files (`src/js/`)
Contains all the game logic, organized by functionality:

- **Scenes (`scenes/`)**:
  - `BootScene.js` - The first scene that loads; sets up game configuration and loads minimal assets needed for the loading screen
  
  - `PreloaderScene.js` - Shows a loading bar while loading all game assets; creates placeholder assets if needed
  
  - `MainMenuScene.js` - The main menu with buttons to start a game or test combat directly
  
  - `MapScene.js` - The run progression map with branching paths and different node types
  
  - `CombatScene.js` - The core gameplay scene where card battles happen; manages turns, player/enemy actions, and victory/defeat conditions

- **Components (`components/`)**:
  - `Card.js` - Defines the Card class that handles card visuals, interactions, dragging, and effect execution
  
  - `Deck.js` - Manages the player's deck, including drawing, discarding, and shuffling mechanisms
  
  - `Enemy.js` - Handles enemy behavior, health, attack patterns, and status effects
  
  - `Player.js` - Controls player stats, health, energy, block, and status effects

- **Configuration (`config/`)**:
  - `CardData.js` - Defines all card properties and effects, organized by risk categories
  
  - `EnemyData.js` - Defines enemy stats, attack patterns, and properties for different threat types

- **Main (`main.js`)**:
  - The entry point for the game; sets up the Phaser game instance and global configuration

#### HTML (`src/index.html`)
The webpage that hosts your game; provides the container where Phaser renders the game.

## How It All Works Together

1. When the game starts, `main.js` initializes Phaser with your configuration

2. Phaser loads the `BootScene` first, which sets up basic game settings and loads minimal assets

3. Then the `PreloaderScene` loads all game assets and shows a loading bar

4. After loading, it transitions to the `MainMenuScene` where players can start the game

5. Selecting "Start Game" takes players to the `MapScene` where they select their path

6. Selecting a combat node transitions to the `CombatScene` where the card gameplay happens

7. The `components` classes (Card, Deck, Enemy, Player) provide the building blocks for the game mechanics

8. The `config` files define the content (cards and enemies) without cluttering the gameplay code

This structure follows good software architecture practices:
- **Separation of concerns**: Each file has a specific responsibility
- **Modularity**: Components can be developed and tested independently
- **Data-driven design**: Game content is defined in configuration files
- **Scene-based organization**: Following Phaser's recommended structure

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this structure in more detail?
